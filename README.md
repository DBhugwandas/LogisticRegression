# LogisticRegression

A few more things to add:
- Built in training/validation split
- Advanced Accuracy metrics - Precision and Recall
- Support for multi-class classification
- Possibly implementing boosting/bagging
- Built in feature normalization
- Additional optimization methods besides gradient descent
